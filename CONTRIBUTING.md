### Important:

If you find a potential exploit or vulnerability, please exercise reasonable disclosure:

1. Privately [contact Overcast Network staff](mailto:support@oc.tc?subject=Important%20security%20vulnerability) about the issue.
2. **Do not** publicly disclose the issue immediately (give Overcast Network staff adequate time to respond to and address your inquiry before you disclose the vulnerability publicly).

## Submitting

### Do:

* Search the issue tracker to ensure that your issue is not a duplicate
* Verify the validity and/or plausibility of your issue
* Be clear and concise in your description
* Take advantage of [GitHub Flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/)--it's awesome, and it makes your submission that much better! :smile:

### Do not:

* Bump issues to receive a response (all issues are acknowledged)
* Argue unproductively in an issue's comments
* Re-create an issue you feel unjustly closed
* Add comments such as :+1:, +1 or "I like this idea"

## Formatting

It is recommended that issues are formatted using the following template for maximum clarity and readability:

### Title

Provide a brief summary of the issue. Your title should allow users browsing the tracker to grasp the gist of your issue at a glance.

**Example**:

> Avatars not displaying correctly in friends list

### Description

Try to separate your description into three different sections, if possible:

1. **The issue**

    This section should provide a detailed explanation of the issue.

2. **Steps to reproduce**

    If applicable, this section should provide a detailed list of steps needed to reproduce the issue.

3. **Miscellaneous information**

    Information that doesn't necessarily fit into any other sections. Common examples are attachments, images, or disclaimers.
